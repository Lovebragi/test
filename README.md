A test python script to help me beat the mini diving game in the game "While the Iron's Hot".
The whole thing is completed under the direction of ChatGPT 3.5, I don't know python at all.
It takes me about 4 hrs to learn how to establish the system enviroment variables and use Chocolately to install app packages.
At last I successfully installed python and vscode, then I copied the code GPT gave, and everything went well.
What a great experience!
